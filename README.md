# üß† EEG Mental Arithmetic Analysis Pipeline

This project uses an open-source EEG dataset from **Zyma et al. (2019)** to build a compact EEG signal processing pipeline. It includes tools for:

- ‚úÖ Time-domain visualization  
- ‚úÖ Spatial scalp topographies  
- ‚úÖ Channel connectivity (correlation)  
- ‚úÖ Frequency-domain analysis (planned)

The goal is to practice applied EEG signal processing by analyzing changes in brain activity during mental arithmetic tasks.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **`utilities.py`**  
  Helper functions for loading, filtering (via Butterworth bandpass), and cleaning EEG data.

- **`Topomap_visual.py`**  
  Generates scalp topographies (topomaps) at different timepoints using MNE, comparing baseline and task conditions.

- **`correlation_matrix.py`**  
  Computes and visualizes Pearson correlation matrices across EEG channels to explore spatial connectivity.

- **`3D_time_domain.py`**  
  Creates interactive 3D time-series plots for selected EEG channels using Matplotlib.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

This project was built in Python 3. You can install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas mne pyedflib
```

## üöÄ How to Run

Download the EEG dataset from PhysioNet.

Place the .edf files inside the project folder (eeg-during-mental-arithmetic-tasks-1.0.0).

Open each script and run them individually depending on the type of analysis:

Topomap: Spatial scalp maps across time.

Correlation: Channel-to-channel connectivity map.

3D: Raw EEG waveforms in 3D space.

(Optional) Modify the selected_channels list to focus on specific electrode locations.
